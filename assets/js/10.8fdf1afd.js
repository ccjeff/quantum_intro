We only have a group of qubits that we use to write information, and we work with those. There isn’t an architecture as complicated as the architecture for a conventional computer. Today, quantum machines are primitive systems akin to a calculator at the turn of the last century, but their computing power for very specific problems is much greater than a traditional computer’s.

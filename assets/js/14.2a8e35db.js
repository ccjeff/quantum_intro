However, there are limitations to using classical computers–even supercomputers–in developing numerical weather and climate prediction models. Also, the process of analyzing the weather data by traditional computers may not be fast enough to keep up with ever-changing weather conditions. Even local weather forecasting, which is rapidly evolving all the time, can stand to benefit from improved forecasting. Take, for example, thunderstorms, where highly accurate and advanced prediction by improved data analysis could minimize the resulting damage, as there could be warning further in advance about potential power outages, and increased preparedness, allowing the local community to restore power faster. So, then, how can weather forecasting be improved on both the local and global scale? Quantum computing has the potential to improve conventional numerical methods to boost tracking and predictions of meteorological conditions by handling huge amounts of data containing many variables efficiently and quickly, by harnessing the computing power of qubits, and by using quantum-inspired optimization algorithms. Moreover, pattern recognition, crucial for understanding the weather, can be enhanced by means of quantum machine learning.")])],1),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"_2-medicine-development"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#_2-medicine-development"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" 2.

The goal of molecular simulation is to find a compound’s most stable configuration, known as its ground state. In order to do this, researchers use M&S systems to simulate the interactions between each of that compound’s electrons, in each atom, in order to test how they will react to one another.

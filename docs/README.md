features:
- title: The Uncertainty Principle, 1927
  details: German physicist Werner Heisenberg introduces the uncertainty principle, which asserts that you can't know everything about a quantum particle at the same time. The more you know about its position, the less you know about its momentum, and vice versa.
- title: Quantum Information Theory, 1970
  details: Notes taken from discussions between Stephen Wiesner and Charlie Bennett (who at the time was still a graduate student at Harvard) contain what may be the first use of the phrase “quantum information theory” and the first suggestion for using entanglement as a communication resource. The notes also describe the principle of superdense coding, eventually published in 1992 by Wiesner and Bennett.
- title: Shor's Factoring Algorithm, 1994
  details: MIT’s Peter Shor shows that it’s possible to factor a number into its primes effeciently on a quantum computer — a problem that takes classical computers “an exponentially long time” to solve for large numbers. His algorithm launches an explosion of theoretical and experimental interest in the field of quantum computing.

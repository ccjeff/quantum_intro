## What is Quantum Computer
<font size = 4> Quantum computer is a computer that carries out high-speed mathematical and logical, stores and processes quantum information in accordance with the laws of quantum mechanics. Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers.</font>

## Why Quantum Computer
<font size = 4 > The promise of developing a quantum computer sophisticated enough to execute Shor's algorithm for large numbers has been a primary motivator for advancing the field of quantum computation. To develop a broader view of quantum computers, however, it is important to understand that they will likely deliver tremendous speed-ups for only specific types of problems. Researchers are working to both understand which problems are suited for quantum speed-ups and develop algorithms to demonstrate them. In general, it is believed that quantum computers will help immensely with problems related to optimization, which play key roles in everything from defense to financial trading. </font> 

<font size = 4 > Multiple additional applications for qubit systems that are not related to computing or simulation also exist and are active areas of research. Two of the most prominent areas are (1) quantum sensing and metrology, which leverage the extreme sensitivity of qubits to the environment to realize sensing beyond the classical shot noise limit, and (2) quantum networks and communications, which may lead to revolutionary ways to share information. </font>

## Classic Computer and Quantum Computer  

<font size = 4> The first thing to bear in mind is that they use different basic units of data: ‘bits’ and ‘qubits’. Every element of a classical computer is written in binary code (1s and 0s) and is translated into electricity: high voltage is represented by 1, and low voltage by 0. In quantum computing, qubits are the basic unit and their value can be 1, 0, or 1 and 0 simultaneously, overlapping (superposition) and intertwining (entanglement) according to the laws of physics. This means that qubits, as opposed to bits, can take on various values at one time and can perform calculations that a conventional computer cannot.</font> 

<font size = 4 > Juan José García Ripoll, researcher at the Institute of Fundamental Physics within the Spanish National Research Council, provides more clues. “In classical computing we know how to solve problems thanks to computer language (AND, OR NOT) used when programming. Operations that are not feasible in bit computing can be performed with a quantum computer. In a quantum computer all the numbers and possibilities that can be created with N qubits are superimposed (if there are 3 qubits, there will be 8 simultaneous possible permutations.) With 1,000 qubits the exponential possibilities far exceed those that we have in classical computing”.</font> 

<font size = 4> Currently, in contrast to classical computing, there are no quantum computing languages per se. Researchers work on developing algorithms (mathematical models that classical computers also work with) that can provide concrete solutions to the problems that are presented. “They work differently. A quantum computer isn’t suitable for performing day-to-day tasks”, Garcia Ripoll explains. “They don’t have memory or a processor. We only have a group of qubits that we use to write information, and we work with those. There isn’t an architecture as complicated as the architecture for a conventional computer. Today, quantum machines are primitive systems akin to a calculator at the turn of the last century, but their computing power for very specific problems is much greater than a traditional computer’s. There is a dichotomy between what appears very simple and what it does, which is very powerful,” García Ripoll points out.</font>

# Three Quantum Algorithms: HHL
---
## HHL
HHL is a quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations. Proposed by Aram Harrow and his team in 2009, the algorithm is one of the main fundamental algorithms expected to provide a speedup over their classical counterparts. For a linear system with N variables and condition number of k, the algorithm is able to achieve the runtime of $O(log(N) k^2)$. This offers an exponential speedup over the fastest classical algorithm.

Input an n Ã— n matrix A and an n-dimensional vector b, the system will output an n-dimensional vector x which satisfies the equation of Ax = b.  
The algorithm is mainly divided into three phases, phase estimation, controlled rotation, and inverse phase estimation.

HLL algorithm is widely used in many quantum machine learning algorithms. According to Jacob Biamonte, well-known methods including Bayesian Inference, Least squares fitting, Quantum PCA, and Quantum SVM all included HLL.

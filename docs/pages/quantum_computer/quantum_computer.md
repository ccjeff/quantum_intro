## What is Quantum Computer
<font size = 4> Quantum computer is a computer that carries out high-speed mathematical and logical, stores and processes quantum information in accordance with the laws of quantum mechanics.</font>

## Qubit
<font size = 4 > 
All computation logic in conventional computers is based on binary operations. One bit is 0 or 1 caused by low or high voltage. Every bitâ€™s value is determined. However, for quantum bit, Qubit for short, it is not like this. Based on the properties of quantum superposition, one Qubit can be both 1 and 0 before it is observed. In this situation, one Qubit has two values. 100 Qubit can store 2^100 numbers at the same time. This feature makes quantum computer show extraordinary talents on parallel computing, information safety and so on. </font>

## Quantum Hegemony
<font size = 4> Quantum hegemony is the potential ability of quantum computers to solve problems that classical computers can't solve. Quantum advantage is the ability to solve problem faster. From the perspective of computational complexity theory, this usually means providing an exponential acceleration beyond known or possible classical algorithms. Compared with Moore's Law, the performance of quantum computers will develop at a double exponential rate. </br>
It is generally believed that quantum computers can coplete the complex calculations that traditional computers take thousands of years to realize in a few minutes, and even find solutions to complex calculations such as protein folding in a few minus. The rules of game in cryptography, chemistry, biopharmaceuical and other fields may change in the future.</font>

## Difficulty
* <font size = 4 > For the problem of quantum precision: the error rate of quantum computer is very high. That is to say, although it is very advanced, the accuracy can't be guaranteed. This is a fatal flaw for computers.</font> 
* <font size = 4 >For the problem of quantum scalability: the more Qubit of quantum computer, the lower the overall calculation accuracy will be. </font>

# Quantum Supremacy

## What is quantum supremacy
<font size = 4> Quantum supremacy is the goal of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem that no classical computer can solve in any feasible amount of time. </font> 

<font size=4>"We therefore hope to hasten the onset of the era of quantum supremacy, when we will be able to perform tasks with controlled quantum systems going beyond what can be achieved with ordinary digital computers." </font>

## Bristlecone
<font size = 4> Google believes it is on the verge of "quantum supremacy" with a new 72-cubic quantum processor it develops, reports The Registry online. The term "quantum supremacy" means the moment when a quantum computer will perform better than a traditional computer without getting any data processing errors. </font>

<font size = 4> Calculation errors are one of the main problems with quantum computers. Google believes it is about to solve this problem for the most part. In 2014, the company developed a 9-cubic chip that generated very few errors - less than 1%. </font>

<font size = 4> Now Google says it has scaled up this achievement to a whole 72-cue with the new processor codenamed Bristlecone. This processor aims to preserve the properties and capabilities of its predecessor. But even it will not achieve quantum supremacy.</font>

<font size= 4>According to Google, this chip may be the platform for creating a quantum computer to achieve this. "We are moderately optimistic that Bristlecone can achieve quantum superiority," said Julian Kelley of the Google team on the company's blog.</font>

## Jiuzhang
<font size = 4> In collaboration with the National Center for Concurrent Computer Engineering and Technology, Shanghai Institute of Microsystems, the research team composed by Jiawei Pan, Chaoyang Lu of the University of Science and Technology of China, has constructed Jiuzhang of the 76-photon quantum computing prototype, realizing the fast solution of the Gaussian Boson Sampling task with practical prospect. According to the theory, the quantum computing system of dealing with the Gaussian Boson Sampling one hundred trillion times faster than the fastest supercomputer. In effect, it is 10 billion times faster than the 53 superconducting bit-quantum computing protypes the Google unvelied last year.</font>

<font size = 4>This achievement enables China to successfully reach the first milestone in quantum computing research: quantum supremacy. </font>

<font size = 4> It is worth mentioning that the success of Jiuzhang is not only a milestone in the realization of the quantum supremacy, but also provides a potential prospect for the second step to solve a number of problems of great practical value that supercomputers are not capable. The Gaussian Boson Sampling algorithm completed in Jiuzhang has potential applications in graphy theory, machine learning, quantum chemistry and other fields. Scientists assume, therefore, the answer to the question of the classic algorithm simulation up difficult if develop a GBS quantum computers, as a special-purpose photon platform, let the molecular vibration, machine learning these complex process, in the form of bose sampling speed, can very well to the application of study is very important in the real world. </font>

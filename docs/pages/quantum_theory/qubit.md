# Fundamental Quantum Theory
## Qubit

- A qubit (or quantum bit) is the quantum mechanical analogue of a classical bit. In classical computing the information is encoded in bits, where each bit can have the value zero or one. In quantum computing the information is encoded in qubits. A qubit is a two-level quantum system where the two basis qubit states are usually written as $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$ and $\left\lvert 1 \right\rangle$. 

- The two orthogonal z-basis states of a qubit are defined as:

  - $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$
  - $\left\lvert 1 \right\rangle$

- When we talk about the qubit basis states we implicitly refer to the z-basis states as the computational basis states.

  The two orthogonal x-basis states are: 
  $\vert +\rangle =\frac{\vert 0\rangle + \vert 1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \vert -\rangle =\frac{\vert 0\rangle - \vert 1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$

  The two orthogonal y-basis states are:
  $\vert R\rangle =\frac{\vert 0\rangle + \imath \vert 1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}∣L⟩=\frac{\vert 0\rangle - \imath \vert 1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$

  The basis states are located at opposite points on the Bloch sphere representation of the state of a single qubit.
